### TASK 1 - Test integration with Slack
* Okay the first things I noticed while searching for probable zulip integrations are the lack of third party integration tutorials. Most of them are just integrations to Slack and there is no proper documentation, for obtaining the payload the API section is nowhere to be found. The most common thing I found while looking for Integrations are : Want to add your own integration? Contact Us.

The integration specified on the GCI tasks page.
* HelloSign : Callback provided. Need to provide credit card information to login. Easy enough. https://www.hellosign.com/api/eventsAndCallbacksWalkthrough
* Heroku : Good documentation for hooks. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploy-hooks
* Mention : Good and detailed documenta https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/#payload-url https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/
* appfollow : I couldn't find the documentation for integrating with third party applications nor the callback URL.
